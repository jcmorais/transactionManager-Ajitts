/**
 * Stores the mapping between a particular cell id and the commit timestamp
 * of the last transaction that changed it.
 *
 * The mapping is implemented as a long -> long mapping, using a single long [].
 * For a map of size N we create an array of size 2*N and store the keys
 * on even indexes and values on odd indexes. The rationale is that we want
 * queries to be fast and touch as least memory regions as possible.
 *
 * Each time an entry is removed, the caller updates the largestDeletedTimestamp
 * if the entry's commit timestamp is greater than this value.
 *
 * TODO: improve garbage collection, right now an entry is picked at random
 * (by hash) which could cause the eviction of a very recent timestamp
